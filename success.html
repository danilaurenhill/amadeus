  <center><h2>Pilar Hill, Age 11</h2></center>
  <center><h3>At the age of 5, Pilar expressed an interest in learning to play the violin.  Her mother went out to rent one the very next day and set up for her to begin instruction that very week.  When she arrived back at home, eager for lessons and excited by the prospect of learning to play her new instrument, Pilar took out the violin and pretended to play it.  As she did, her father’s face fell... Pilar held the instrument the way that was comfortable for her, it just so happened to not be in the manner that was standard.  She naturally grafted towards holding the violin as a southpaw would. That is because she is left-handed.  Her parents were very concerned about her left-handedness posing a problem to this pursuit.  They weren’t sure if it would be psychologically sound for such a young child to play an instrument in a manner that was not congruent to her natural mode of learning.  Many questions were posed and after a lot of discussion, they decided that it would be best for Pilar to play either the piano or guitar.  A few months had passed and Pilar did start learning to play the piano from her father.  One day, as her mother was walking past her room, Pilar was seen looking in a mirror playing a comb and brush as a violin and bow.  She would soon do this more regularly and in full view throughout the day.  Her mother’s curiosity was piqued, but it was not until Pilar confided in her that although she would play the piano, “ it was not my instrument.”  With those words, the revelation was finally understood and accepted; no longer would Pilar’s parents believe her true calling. The next morning, her mother registered Pilar for violin lessons and rented an instrument.
  Pilar had always been an exceptional child whom many in her family considered to be an old soul and wise beyond her years.  She would content herself as a toddler for hours with volumes of minimally illustrated classic children’s literature, science periodicals and she would often be seen flipping through pages of home and garden magazines.  When she wasn’t engaged however, she would often be running all over the house and down the street at top speed often necessitating several trips to the emergency room.  Her mind was always active. She never napped.  At 9 months of age, she started speaking in full sentences and by age 4, she was reading on a second grade level.  Children’s toys and games were of no interest to Pilar in much the same way as taking them apart to find out how they work. It is with this energy that Pilar advanced very quickly in her playing.</h3></center>

  <center><h2>Faith Pak, age 19</h2></center>
  <center><h3>I began playing the violin at the age of five, and I came to study with I-Hao Lee when i was seven years old. Amadeus Music School was a big part of my childhood--I remember practicing my etudes and songs, and having plenty of snack parties with friends. At the age of 12 I found my real passion in the viola, which I liked better than violin for its mellower, more calming tone. With Mr. Lee's devotion and guidance, I eventually made it into Juilliard Pre-College and the National Youth Orchestra of the USA, where I got to play as principal violist for two summer tours to China and Europe! I'm currently a student at Harvard University, where I study comparative literature and play principal viola in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. I definitely couldn't made it so far without the unique learning environment of Amadeus, and the lessons from Mr. Lee on how to play in tune and dream big. ^_^

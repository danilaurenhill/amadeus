  <h3>The Amadeus Music School offers private lessons in:</h3>

  <center><h4>Amadeus Music School was founded in 1992 by graduates of The Juilliard School. From the start, our goal has been to provide the finest quality music education programs to the community. Combined with professional management and outstanding faculty, the continuous, high-level achievements of our students have enabled Amadeus to become a top choice for music education.Amadeus offers music lessons to students of all ages. Whether you are pursuing a new hobby or reconnecting with a childhood passion, we do our best to ensure that you have a great experience.</h4></center><br><br><br>
  <h2 style="color: #A9A9A9;">Schedule</h2>
  <center><h4>Students of all ages may schedule weekly or bi-weekly lessons for 30, 45 or 60 minutes. Lessons can be scheduled for Weekdays from 2pm to 6pm, or Saturdays & Sundays from 9am to 6pm.</h4></center><br><br><br>
  <h2 style="color: #A9A9A9;">Recitals and Concerts</h2>
  <center><h4 style="padding-bottom: 60px;">There are two kinds of regular performance given at the Amadeus: recitals and concerts.  Recitals are generally held in front of a small, friendly audience and aim to build confidence and prepare students for concert performance. Two recitals are held each year. Concerts, which take place in front of a larger audience, give the students a chance to perform on a big stage, exposing them to a professional performance setting. We strongly believe that performance experience is a vital part of music education. Preparing for performances provides students with a short-term goal, which serves to maintain their interest in playing and increase their level of achievement. While other music schools charge a fee for concerts, all Amadeus recitals and concerts are free of charge to students.<br><br>
  Outstanding students are given the opportunity to perform at various concert halls, such as Carnegie Weill Hall and Flushing Town Hall. Students also get the chance to perform at prestigious events to which Amadeus is frequently invited.</h4></center>
